# Project Planning Guide

## Project File Structure

When planning new features or changes, create a project file that outlines:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the feature/change
2. **Requirements** - Detailed list of requirements
3. **Steps** - Breakdown of implementation steps
4. **Validation** - How to verify the implementation

## Example Project File

Here's an example project file for adding a portfolio projects section:

```markdown
# Portfolio Projects Feature Implementation

## Overview

Add a portfolio projects section to showcase work examples with filtering capabilities and detailed project pages.

## Requirements

- Display projects in a grid layout with filtering options
- Each project should have an image, title, description, technologies used, and links
- Projects should be filterable by technology/category
- Each project should have its own detailed page
- Admin interface for adding/editing projects
- Mobile-responsive design

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  content: string; // Markdown content
  image: string;
  technologies: string[];
  category: string;
  links: {
    github?: string;
    demo?: string;
    article?: string;
  };
  featured: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Project Data Structure and API

Reference: [docs/ai/data-modeling.md]

- Create project interface/type definition
- Set up project data storage (JSON, database, CMS)
- Implement API routes for fetching projects

### 2. Implement Project Grid Component

Reference: [docs/ai/components.md]

- Create ProjectCard component
- Create ProjectGrid component with filtering
- Implement technology/category filter UI
- Add responsive layout for different screen sizes

### 3. Create Project Detail Page

Reference: [docs/ai/page-routing.md]

- Create dynamic route for project pages ([slug])
- Implement project detail layout
- Add related projects section
- Implement navigation between projects

### 4. Add Admin Interface

Reference: [docs/ai/forms.md]

- Create project form component
- Implement create/edit/delete functionality
- Add image upload capability
- Implement validation

### 5. Testing and Optimization

Reference: [docs/ai/testing.md]

- Write tests for components and API routes
- Optimize images and loading performance
- Add error handling and loading states

## Validation

- All projects display correctly in the grid
- Filtering works as expected
- Project detail pages load the correct project data
- Admin interface allows creating and editing projects
- Layout is responsive and works on mobile devices
- All tests pass
```

## Project Step Template

When implementing features, break down each step into smaller tasks:

```markdown
### Step: [Step Name]

Reference: [link to relevant documentation]

#### Tasks:
1. [Task 1 description]
2. [Task 2 description]
3. [Task 3 description]

#### Files to Create/Modify:
- `path/to/file1.tsx`: [Brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file2.tsx`: [Brief description of changes]

#### Implementation Notes:
- [Important implementation detail 1]
- [Important implementation detail 2]

#### Success Criteria:
- [What should work after this step is complete]
```

## Project Implementation Guidelines

When implementing a project plan:

1. **Start with data models and types**
   - Define your interfaces/types first
   - Establish the relationships between different entities

2. **Implement core functionality before UI refinements**
   - Get the basic functionality working first
   - Polish UI details after core features work

3. **Use incremental development**
   - Implement one step at a time
   - Test each step before moving to the next
   - Commit code after completing each step

4. **Document as you go**
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update project documentation with any design decisions

5. **Use a consistent commit structure**
   - Format: `[Feature/Fix/Refactor]: Brief description`
   - Include the task/step number from the project plan

## Project Review Checklist
